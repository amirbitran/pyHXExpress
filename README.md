# [pyHXExpress](https://github.com/tuttlelm/pyHXExpress)
This is a python adaptation of [HX-Express](https://www.hxms.com/HXExpress/) [[1]](#1) to perform 
polymodal fits of Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) data. This package can be 
used for high throughput analysis of entire peptide pools and beyond. The pyHXExpress tools can be 
used in python scripts or used interactively within Jupyter Notebooks. The goal of this project is 
to allow users to easily interact with their data and subsequent outputs to gain statistically 
supported insights into the polymodality of the HDX data.
